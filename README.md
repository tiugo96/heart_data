# Note on OOP

An object-oriented programming (OOP) section is incorporated at the end of the script. This section is just to play around and involves aspects such as: 
* Creating classes and writing functions (class methods)
* Importing custom classes into the main script


Benefits of OOP: 
* Clean, maintainable code
* Less redundancy
* Facilitates testing
* Better suited for production environments, due to the reasons listed above


However, it is challenging to identify how an OOP approach can be applied in the context of Data Science.
In my oppinion, applying OOP in the context of Data Science may depend on factors such as:
* The actual data science project itself (e.g. what the business problem is etc.)
* The number of collaborators (developers)
* Whether the code will be deployed into production
* ... and other factors




# Python environment setup
